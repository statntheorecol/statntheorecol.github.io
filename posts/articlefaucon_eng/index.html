  <section>
    <p><strong>The annual probability of survival of the average adult individual is
a critical parameter for demographic projections of long-lived animal
populations. Indeed, small changes to this adult survival rate can yield
large changes in the rate of population growth or decline. Yet this
parameter was still unknown for the Gyrfalcon, an iconic raptor living
in boreal and arctic ecosystems. In a recent <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/12404">PeerJ article</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Ólafur K. Nielsen and I estimate adult as well as
juvenile survival rates for the Icelandic population of gyrfalcons.</strong></p>
<p>   </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>   </p>
<p>The Gyrfalcon is the largest of all extant falcons, slightly larger and
heavier than a buzzard. Gyrfalcons used to be exported in past centuries
from Iceland to mainland Europe (and beyond) for use in the falconries
of kings. For this reason, we have detailed information about long-term
trends, and therefore know that the Icelandic gyrfalcon and its main
prey (rock ptarmigan) both have oscillations in population size<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
But surprisingly, basic components of ecological knowledge such as
survival rates of this famous bird (now protected) were still lacking,
not only in Iceland, but also all over the gyrfalcon&rsquo;s circumpolar
population range.</p>
<p>We estimate annual survival rates to be on average 83% [79%; 87%] for
adults and 40% [34%; 45%] for juveniles<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. A linear regression of
annual survival rates in raptors with body mass<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> yields a predicted
81% for adults: we therefore confirm that adult survival rates in
long-lived birds are quite predictable. However, although the <em>average</em>
adult survival rate is predictable, there is broad variability around
the mean: the individuals that live the longest do so for 15 years or
so, while the expected average lifespan is around 8 years. These
differences are likely due to human-induced mortality (1 in 4 x-rayed
dead falcon had embedded shotgun pellets). Juvenile survival was about
half that of adult survival, again a relatively expected result for
birds, and was - a little more surprisingly - neither related to weather
nor main prey (rock ptarmigan) density. We suspect that this is because
these variables had to be spatially averaged, as we model the survival
rates of the average individual while in fact juveniles do move around
within Iceland (but we do not know their detailed locations).</p>
<p>We used a multistage hidden Markov model combining
capture-mark-recapture (from live individuals) and mark-recovery data
(from dead individuals). Most capture-recapture models that estimate
survival and detection probabilities for plant and animal species belong
to hidden Markov models<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These models are called hidden because
some states of the animals cannot be directly observed, only inferred.
This particular model is called multistage because it uses three hidden
states to combine information from encounters of observers with both
live and dead individuals<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This “data fusion” technique helps to
get survival estimates when data is scarce. In the model, we define
observed states <em>L</em>: seen or captured alive; <em>D</em>: recovered dead; <em>U</em>:
neither seen, captured nor recovered, which leads to a time series of
observed states such as LUUULUUDUUUUU for each individual in the dataset<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.
These observed states are then related through probabilities to
the true states of an individual (1: alive; 2: recently dead; 3: long
dead) - an individual may very well be alive but unobserved, or recently
dead but not yet found. State 2 helps to differentiate dead individuals
that have some probability to be found from individuals in state 3 whose
corpses are probably long decomposed. A Markov chain then specifies
transition probabilities between the true states, to which adult and
juvenile annual survival survival probabilities belong to, eventually
modelling the dynamics of survival for each individual bird.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to adjust these complex hierarchical models to
data. One option is a full Bayesian analysis using a variant of the
Gibbs sampler, where we would estimate directly the probabilities of
each latent state (i.e. the probability that individual 347 is alive in
1994). As we have about 1500 individuals monitored for more than 10
years, this option would be a bit cumbersome (more than 15000 parameters
to estimate) and early trials revealed that such models did not converge
very well. Another option is to fit the model through the classical
maximum likelihood framework, using the Forward algorithm<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, a
popular algorithm to fit hidden Markov models to data, which estimates
Markov chain transition parameters without estimating each latent state.
We used an in-between between those two options, using the Forward
algorithm in a Bayesian framework in Stan<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, a software implementing
Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, which helped to provide reliable
credible intervals for parameter estimates.</p>
<p>Ironically, the sad fact that there is substantial variation in realized
lifespan of falcons - likely due to humans - helped us keep the model
simple, since Markov models assume geometrically distributed lifespans
(the geometric distribution has such broad variability). If all adults
had died at roughly the same ages, we would have been constrained to use
more complex semi-Markov models<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These analyses have resulted not only from the efforts of the
researchers (one of whom did a large portion of the captures starting in
1981) but also from the efforts of many others who were involved at
various stages during the four decades of data collection. In recent
years, more and more “recaptures” have in fact been re-sightings of
birds by volunteers through photography, a fact made possible by
improvement in camera technology. These ornithologists cannot be thanked
enough for their critical contribution to knowledge.</p>
<p>This project is part of a long-term study started in 1981 in North-East
Iceland where, in addition to the captures for survival estimation,
gyrfalcons territories are mapped and fecundity at the nest is
evaluated. Our hope is then to combine the survival estimates produced
here with the rest of the data into demographic models predicting the
Icelandic gyrfalcon population’s trends, and its possible trophic
linkages to its prey, the rock ptarmigan.</p>
