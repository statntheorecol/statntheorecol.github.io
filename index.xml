      <description>Some good news from the past and starting year:
 Yohan Sahraoui, Laure Carassou and researchers from Biogeco have published in Land Use Planning the results of their investigations regarding how changes in land use in the Bordeaux conurbation will affect ecological connectivity. They have coupled a spatial network model of ecological connectivity to a participatory modelling approach from social sciences. By doing so, they uncovered that the anticipated impacts on ecological connectivity of urban sprawl and densification are unfortunately quite similar to the worst scenarios for future urban development (!</description>

      <description>The annual probability of survival of the average adult individual is a critical parameter for demographic projections of long-lived animal populations. Indeed, small changes to this adult survival rate can yield large changes in the rate of population growth or decline. Yet this parameter was still unknown for the Gyrfalcon, an iconic raptor living in boreal and arctic ecosystems. In a recent PeerJ article1, Ólafur K. Nielsen and I estimate adult as well as juvenile survival rates for the Icelandic population of gyrfalcons.</description>

      <description>La probabilité annuelle de survie de l&amp;rsquo;individu adulte moyen est un paramètre critique pour les projections démographiques des populations animales longévives. En effet, de petits changements dans ce taux de survie des adultes peuvent entraîner de grandes variations dans le taux de croissance ou de déclin de la population. Pourtant, ce paramètre était encore inconnu pour le faucon gerfaut, un rapace charismatique qui vit dans les écosystèmes boréaux et arctiques. Dans un article récent paru dans PeerJ1, Ólafur K.</description>

      <description>I have a new postdoc position opening (details in linked pdf) on improving dynamic models including interactions within and between species, notably their identifiability properties, by combining different kinds of data.
I would be open to a variety of candidate profiles, ranging from somebody with statistical or probability background that would focus on mathematical aspects of identifiability, to somebody more interested in fitting dynamic models to data. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me for an informal chat if you may be interested.</description>

© copyright : Sylvie Richart Cervera [INRAE]  
The ANTOPTIC (Analysis of trophic network to optimize the delivery of natural pest control services) project, led by SAVE and BioGeCo (INRA), aims to answer main two questions:
1) What are the effects of farming practices and landscape context on the structure of arthropod food webs in vineyards?
2) What is the relationship between the structure of arthopod food webs and the levels of pest control ?</description>

      <description>I am a bio-informatics engineer with a particular expertise in data mining and database development.
Generally speaking, I am interested in everything linked with data mining: management, exploitation and analysis (especially for big volumes of data). I used to work in vegetable genomics, in diverse projects related to data mining, which includes database design (associated with the development of a website), analysis of sequences from NGS techniques (Populus nigra, Pisum sativum), the development of procedure for genome reconstruction (de novo assembly) in the case of small computing resources, and the development of protocols for the selection of SNP which can be applied to genotyping chip.</description>

      <description>I am a quantitative ecologist, with interests ranging from population dynamics or coexistence theory to the statistical analysis of time series.
Most of my research deals with ecological interactions in a dynamic setting (and sometimes a spatially explicit one). Some more details in my personal webpage.
Current projects include, on the technical side:
 multivariate time series methods to infer causal relationships data fusion techniques for mechanistic ecological models identifiability properties of such models  Some fundamental ecological questions that interest me:</description>

      <description>Research themes and questions Ecology-driven research interests Research in the statistical and theoretical ecology group ranges from behavioural to community ecology
 Population cycles are regular fluctuations in population size with large amplitude (2-3 orders of magnitude or more). What are their causes?
 To what extent do predators regulate their prey?
 How can seemingly similar species manage to coexist? (aka the paradox of the plankton, though this apply to other plant species)</description>

      <description>We just came back from SFEcologie 2018 &amp;ndash; a great conference in Rennes!
Alix presented her latest work on seasonal dynamic food webs; Coralie had a poster on diversity maintenance in (also seasonal) theoretical competitive communities, and myself a presentation of our empirical analyses of phytoplankton community dynamics.
I really enjoyed Teja Tscharnkte&amp;rsquo;s plenary on integrating biodiversity services in agriculture.

      <description>The ‘Biodiver&amp;rsquo;Cité’ project aims at designing guidelines for the preservation of biodiversity in urban landscapes.
The first version of this project (2017-2020) had four major objectives :
1) quantify biodiversity in the urban and suburban landscapes of the city of Bordeaux. This is done in a multi-taxa framework, using major groups of terrestrial and aquatic fauna, based on historical databases as well as new data collection (groups targeted include butterflies, damselflies, dragonflies, amphibians, fishes)</description>

      <description>Time series analysis In collaboration with Ifremer Arcachon, we work on phytoplankton community dynamics, especially diatoms (one of the most abundant classes of plankton, actively involved in biogeochemical cycles).
We are particularly interested in:
 Drivers of blooms Coexistence mechanisms  Our research combines long-term data with statistical and theoretical models.
Our analyses of the time series in Arcachon Bay can be found in Barraquand et al. 2018, Oikos. This work has been extended to the French coastline in Picoche et al.</description>

      <description>I now work as a project officer for the French Comittee of the IUCN, in charge of the Red List of Ecosystems As a community ecologist, I am keen on investigating the structure of ecological communities as well as their dynamics, so as to understand how they respond to disturbances. I study ecological communities as networks of interactions, trying to capture the architecture of such webs, their variabilities and their dynamics.</description>

I have been studying fish in a variety of ecosystems (estuaries, coral reefs or other coastal and pelagic marine environments from Europe, south Pacific, northern Gulf of Mexico, west and south Africa, northwest Indian Ocean). I combine diverse methodological approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of fish populations in the context of climatic and environmental variability (trophic studies based on gut contents, stable isotopes, fatty acids, and/or multivariate statistical approaches).</description>

      <description>I am interested in behavioral ecology and population dynamics. I aim to better understand and predict population fluctuations by integrating information on interactions within (e.g. parental effects and social behaviour) as well as among species (e.g. competition and predation), notably using data integration (Integrated Population and Community Models).

I currently work with Frederic Barraquand on the identifiability of dynamic models including interactions within and between species (Integrated Community Models).</description>
